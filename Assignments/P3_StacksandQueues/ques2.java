/* A homeowner rents out parking spaces in a driveway during special events. The driveway is a “last-in, first-out” stack. Of course, when a car owner retrieves a vehicle that wasn’t the last one in, the cars blocking it must temporarily move to the street so that the requested vehicle can leave. Write a program that models this behavior, using one stack for the driveway and one queue for the street. Use integers as license plate numbers to identify an individual car. 
Definition of Done
i. The program uses one stack for “driveway” and one queue for “street" and uses "license plate number" to represent individual cars
ii. The user inputs the car license number to retrieve a car
iii. Display the resultant driveway and street after every car moves out */
