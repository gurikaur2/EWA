/* Write a program that implements a simple spell checker using a hash table. Your spell-checker will be reading from two input files.
The first file is a dictionary "dictionary.txt". The program should read the dictionary and insert the words into a hash table.  After reading the dictionary, it will read a list of words from a second file. The goal of the spell-checker is to determine the misspelled words in the second file by looking each word up in the dictionary. The program should output each misspelled word.

Definition of Done

The program should read two files namely, “dictionary.txt” and “words.txt”
It should check the misspelled words given in “words.txt” and display such words
Use the appropriate Collection that implements the hashtable for storing items

To implement basic operations on:

HashMap
TreeMap
LinkedHashMap */
